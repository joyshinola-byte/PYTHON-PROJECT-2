Introduction

The Titanic dataset contains passenger information from the 1912 Titanic ship disaster. This project analyzes survival patterns using Python and the Pandas library.

🔹 Titanic Dataset Overview

The dataset includes details such as PassengerId, Name, Age, Gender, Class, Fare, and Survival status. It helps in understanding how different factors influenced passenger survival.

🔹 Methodology

The dataset was imported using Pandas and cleaned by handling missing values. Data analysis techniques such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation were applied.

🔹 Statistical Analysis

Statistical functions like mean, sum, and groupby() were used to analyze survival rates based on gender, class, age, and fare. Patterns affecting survival were identified through descriptive analysis.

🔹 Conclusion

The analysis shows that gender, passenger class, and fare significantly influenced survival chances. Female and first-class passengers had higher survival rates compared to others.
